Metallica Responsive Website Project!

What does the website do and what need does it fulfil?

This project uses skills that have been learnt to build a mobile-first responsive
Website for the legendary band Metallica. It fulfils the need for fans and potential
fans to listen to Metallica’s music, watch Metallica’s music videos, join a fan club
enquire to hire the band through a contact form, view their album covers and gain
further information on the albums as well as view pictures of the band and concerts.
Functionality of the project.
The Website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes, there is a small
amount of additional content in the form of an extra paragraph on the Home Page.
The navigation is functional and two forms (Join our fan club and hire us) are input
validated which then resolves to a thankyou page. These forms are not fully
functional in that they do not alert anyone from the team that a form has been filled in
also they do not fill a database. Currently the Join our fan club and the Hire us
thankyou page does work on my local desktop and on Github.

Technologies used.

• HTML5
• CSS3
• Bootstrap
• GitPod
• GitHub
• Google Chrome Developer Tools
• JavaScript & jQuery

Deployment.

Each page was tested locally on GitPod using Chrome Developer Tools, testing it’s
functionality as well as it’s look and feel in landscape and portrait mode on a range of
different devices such as Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, Galaxy S5, iPhone 7, iPhone 8, iPad
and responsive desktop. All links were tested along with music track audio player. The
Modal Hire us and Join our fan club were tested locally and remotely.

Work based on other code?

Only the Modal Hire us and sign up form template was used from W3Schools and
Bootstrap. I modified its content and changed some of the code to semantically what
it was being used for. I also changed the styling using CSS and their action to point to
a thankyou page to confirm their action and increase the users experience.

What changed after user design experience (UDX) Phase?

I had to reduce the number of tracks that I originally planned on using for the audio
player due to the file sizes, also I have included an extra thankyou page which the
user will be directed to when they select the submit buttons on both the Fan club
sign up form and the hire us form, so that the user can see the action which will give
them a better user experience.
